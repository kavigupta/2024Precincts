# Additional Data Sources

This directory contains additional data sources that complement the main state-level data in the `states/` directory.

Some of these are chosen because there was no data in the repository originally, some because it didn't line up with the
statewide results as on wikipedia (see Sanity check).

## Michigan, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah
